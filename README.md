# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
The goal was to build the system in such a way that it can recognize the handwritten 
digits provided in the MINIST data set of images of hand written digits (0‐9). The 
data set used for our application is the MNIST data set (originally composed of 
60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images). Each image is a 28 x 28 grayscale 
(0‐255) labelled representation of an individual digit.
The aim of a handwriting recognition system is to convert handwritten characters 
into machine readable formats. Here, we used a neural network, which is having 
wide applications in image classification, object recognition, recommendation 
systems, signal processing, natural language processing, computer vision, and face 
recognition. The ability to automatically detect the important features of an object
without any human supervision.
